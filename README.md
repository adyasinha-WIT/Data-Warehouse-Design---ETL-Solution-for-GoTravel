# Data Warehouse Design & ETL Solution for GoTravel
 

Designed, built, and populated a data mart for GoTravel, a New Zealand national travel agency, to support OLAP applications for analyzing travel bookings data. This project involved designing a snowflake schema, creating an SQL script to build the data mart, and implementing an ETL process to populate it with data from staging tables.

Skills Demonstrated:

    Data Mart Design:

        Designed a snowflake schema using Visio to define the structure of a data mart required for an OLAP application, including tables, relationships, attributes, and keys.

        Created an SQL script to build the data mart by generating the tables and relationships documented within the snowflake schema.

    ETL Implementation:

        Created an Integration Services project to extract data from GoTravel's staging tables and populate the tables within the data mart.

        Configured data transformations to ensure data quality and consistency.

    Reporting and Documentation:

        Documented the design of the snowflake schema and the ETL steps performed to populate the data mart in a comprehensive report.

        Included screen dumps of each Data Flow task after execution within the report.

Softwares Used:

    SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)

    SQL Server

    Visio
